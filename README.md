# Shimeji Repository

Here I store all shimejis that I have created in collaboration with my very artistically skilled sister. At this moment it is only Castiel from Supernatural.

## What is a Shimeji?

Shimejis are little characters (desktop buddies or mascots) who play around in your computer window while you try to finish your work and distract you with their cuteness.

Pick up a shimeji with the mouse pointer, drag them around, and drop them where you want. They walk, crawl, and climb all over your screen and interact with elements on web pages.

They can play on almost every site including Google, YouTube, Facebook, DeviantArt, MyAnimeList, Pinterest, Tumblr, and Instagram.

There are shimeji buddies of many popular anime series, games, movies, animations, etc.
